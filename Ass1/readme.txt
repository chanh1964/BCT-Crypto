*.*.*.*_BCT Crypto v1.2 Manual_*.*.*.*

BCT Crypto is an application built for 'Cryptography & Network Security' course assignment. The application has 3 main features:
- Encrypt/Decrypt a file or folder
- Generate key
- Generate/Check HASH string of files

You will also need to install Java Runtime Environment in order to run application.



*~* ENCRYPT/DECRYPT A FILE OR FOLDER *~*
(Encrypt/Decrypt tab)

Easy Mode:
- Choose algorithm
- Input your key. Please note that each algorithm has its require key length
	AES: 16 digits
	DES: 8 digits
	TripleDES: 24 digits
- Choose your input file/folder
- Choose your output folder
- Click 'Encrypt' of 'Decrypt'
Your encrypted file/folder will be like these: 
*input file name*.*input file extension*.encr 
OR *input folder name*.folder.encr

Advanced Mode
You can enter/exit Advanced Mode by toggling 'Advanced Mode' button.
As you can see when entering Advanced Mode, the 'Mode of Op.' and 'RSA Private Key' options appears.
In this mode, you can't type your key to 'Key' textbox but choosing the key file. You can generate your key file using Key Generator tab (will be instructed later).
You can now choose your preferred mode of operation (default for Easy Mode is ECB). If you choose CBC, you will have to specify the init vector. Init vector can also be generated using Key Generator tab.
The key file/init vector file is encrypted using RSA algorithm. To be able for the application to read your key/init vector, you will also have to specify the RSA Private Key. You can choose to use application's default RSA Private key or use your own (can also be be generated using Key Generator tab).
That's all for the differences. If you have fill the required inputs for Advanced Mode, just click Encrypt/Decrypt to finish your work.



*~* GENERATE KEY *~*
(Key Generator tab)

You can generate random key string, init vector string, export them to key/init vector file or export your custom (type-in) key/init vector file.
You can also generate RSA Key Pair (Public Key & Private Key).

Steps to create key/init vector file:
- Choose algorithm
- Input your own key/init vector string or click 'Generate' to generate a random one
- Specify RSA Public Key (or use application's default) to encrypt your key/init vector file
- Choose your output folder
- Specify your key/init vector name
- Click 'Export'
Your key/init vector will be like these:
*name*.*algorithm* OR *name*.inv.*algorithm*

Steps to create RSA Key Pair:
- Choose output folder
- Specify your key pair name
- Click 'Generate'
Your key pair files will be like these:
*name*.pubk for RSA Public Key and
*name*.prik for RSA Private Key
Please note that these two keys are unique for each other. You can't decrypt a file encrypted by another RSA Public Key.



*~* GENERATE/CHECK HASH STRING OF FILES *~*
(MD5 tab)

HASH string is used to check the integrity of a file.
To generate HASH string of a file , simply choose your input file and click 'Generate'.
To check whether your file is changed, simply choose your input file, input HASH string or choose your other file and click 'Check'.
Please note that HASH string generated by this application uses MD5 HASH Function.
